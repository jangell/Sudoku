# Sudoku
This is a simple sudoku solver, with a text input &amp; output, written in Python. It's a personal project, and it's currently only one file, with the data structures and algorithms written in the Puzzle class and testing done below. The Move and OptionList classes are depricated; they were used at different development stages, but don't factor into the current solution.
